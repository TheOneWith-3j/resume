Scope Beneficial for both the deaf/mute and those unfamiliar with sign language, this system interprets sign language gestures, providing output in both text and speech formats. Ease of communication is enhanced, allowing meaningful interactions between individuals regardless of sign language knowledge. In addition, our system extends its capabilities to Youtube videos, providing an inclusive experience by converting captions into live sign language gestures. Future collaborations with Youtube and Google envision avatars translating captions into dynamic gestures.",
